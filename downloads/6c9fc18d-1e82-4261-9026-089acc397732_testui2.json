            "content": "# Optional Uptake of New Features (Opt In)\nOracle Cloud Applications delivers new updates every quarter. This means every three months you'll receive new functionality to help you efficiently and effectively manage your business. Some features are delivered Enabled meaning they are immediately available to end users. Other features are delivered Disabled meaning you have to take action to make available. Features delivered Disabled can be activated for end users by stepping through the following instructions using the following privileges:\nReview Applications Offering (ASM_REVIEW_APPLICATIONS_OFFERINGS_PRIV)\nConfigure Oracle Fusion Applications Offering (ASM_CONFIGURE_OFFERING_PRIV)\nHereâs how you opt in to new features:\nClick Navigator > My Enterprise >New Features.\nOn the Features Overview page, select your offering to review new features specific to it. Or, you can leave the default selectionAll Enabled Offeringsto review new features for all offerings.\nOn the New Features tab, review the new features and check the opt-in status of the feature in theEnabledcolumn. If a feature has already been enabled, you will see a check mark. Otherwise, you will see an icon to enable the feature.\nClick the icon in theEnabledcolumn and complete the steps to enable the feature.\nIn some cases, you might want to opt in to a feature that's not listed in the New Features work area. Here's how to opt in:\nClick Navigator > My Enterprise >Offerings.\nOn the Offerings page, select your offering, and then clickOpt In Features.\nOn the Opt In page, click theEdit Features(pencil) icon for the offering, or for the functional area that includes your feature.\nOn the Edit Features page, complete the steps to enable the feature.\nFor more information and detailed instructions on opting in to new features for your offering, seeConfigure Offerings.\nOpt In Expiration\nOccasionally, features delivered Disabled via Opt In may be enabled automatically in a future update. This is known as an Opt In Expiration. If your cloud service has any Opt In Expirations you will see a related tab in this document. Click on that tab to see when the feature was originally delivered Disabled, and when the Opt In will expire, potentially automatically enabling the feature. You can alsoclick hereto see features with Opt In Expirations across all Oracle Cloud Applications.",

It's the second week of the month, and Amy wants to review the last two week's of unbilled labor transactions on one of her projects with the client.\nAmy navigates to the Project Management work area, selects the desired project from the My Projects list, and then selects the new Manage Bill Transactions link from the task drawer. The Bill Transactions page opens showing transactions for which Amy has data access, with a filter applied for the project that was selected in the My Projects page.The Bill Transactions page is also available to Amy's Project Administrators who work in the PMO. The Manage Bill Transactions link is accessed from the task drawer of the Project Financial Management work area.\nThe Bill Transactions page is also available to Amy's Project Administrators who work in the PMO. The Manage Bill Transactions link is accessed from the task drawer of the Project Financial Management work area.\nAmy can refine her search criteria to address her specific business questions:Add a filter on transaction type to restrict to labor transactions.Add a filter on transaction date range to restrict transactions to the last two weeks.Add a filter on status to only show transactions that are unbilled.\nAdd a filter on transaction type to restrict to labor transactions.\nAdd a filter on transaction date range to restrict transactions to the last two weeks.\nAdd a filter on status to only show transactions that are unbilled.\nDuring the review with the client, a potential issue is spotted with the number of hours booked by a project team member on a specific date (12 hours were booked, but Amy and the client were expecting 8 hours). To ensure these transactions are not billed yet, Amy selects the transactions and changes their status to \"On hold\", choosing an appropriate action reason (\"Client query\") from the configurable list. Amy creates a browser bookmark for the page, which includes her search criteria, so that she can come back to this context later if needed.\nAmy discusses the issue with the project team member, who confirms that they did work 12 hours to complete a task, which was more than the planned amount agreed with the client. Amy now has four options:Inform the client of the overrun to gauge appetite for payment. Or,Ask the team member to change their time card to 8 hours. This is not ideal as it means that effort versus plan reporting will be skewed, as will the project cost. Or,Split the project cost into billable (8 hours) and nonbillable (4 hours) transactions. This will result in an additional bill transaction being created. Or,(New in this release) Liaise with the Project Billing Specialist to amend the bill quantity for this transaction to 8 hours in the Bill Transactions page. This change does not affect the effort recorded on the project cost transaction. Subject to privilege, Project Managers can also perform this action if desirable, refer to the Access Requirements section.\nInform the client of the overrun to gauge appetite for payment. Or,\nAsk the team member to change their time card to 8 hours. This is not ideal as it means that effort versus plan reporting will be skewed, as will the project cost.

Or,\n(New in this release) Liaise with the Project Billing Specialist to amend the bill quantity for this transaction to 8 hours in the Bill Transactions page. This change does not affect the effort recorded on the project cost transaction. Subject to privilege, Project Managers can also perform this action if desirable, refer to the Access Requirements section.\nAmy decides that option 4 is the best way to remediate the issue. Once the Project Billing Specialist has made the change, Amy updates the status of the bill transaction back to \"Ready\" (to bill), choosing an appropriate action reason (\"PM reviewed\") from the configurable list of values.\nBen Simmons, Project Billing Specialist\nBen is responsible for the smooth operation of the project billing process within the Vision Operations organization. Ben services the billing needs of 100 project managers, each managing anywhere from 1 to 10 billable projects at a time.\nA project manager informs Ben that the monthly unbilled fee amount for a number of projects doesn't look right. Fees have been added to each project for 1,000 USD, but they should have been 1,500 USD. The projects are all for the same client, and project numbering has been configured such that projects for the same client start with the same code, \"HILMAN\".\nBen navigates to the Contract Management > Invoices work area, and selects the new Manage Bill Transactions link from the task drawer. The Bill Transactions page opens showing the bill transactions for which Ben has data access.\nBen uses the reduction list of the Project filter chip to filter all projects starting with \"HILMAN\". Ben applies additional filters as needed:Adds a filter on transaction type to restrict to fee transactions.Adds a filter on transaction date range to restrict transactions to the current month.Adds a filter on status to only show transactions that are unbilled.\nAdds a filter on transaction type to restrict to fee transactions.\nAdds a filter on transaction date range to restrict transactions to the current month.\nAdds a filter on status to only show transactions that are unbilled.\nBen sees 20 fee transactions that have an amount to bill of 1,000 USD. Ben selects the transactions, and takes an action to change the amount to bill to 1,500 USD as instructed. A message is displayed informing Ben that the action has been completed successfully, and the changes are automatically synchronized to the associated billing events.\nBen is able to take similar actions to change the unit price and bill quantity of transactions that are priced on a quantity-basis.\n\nThe key business benefits of this feature are:\nAlleviate time pressures at billing period end by continuously reviewing and adjusting unbilled transactions, without needing to generate invoices prematurely.\nProvides an alternate approach to quickly rectify missing rate exceptions, without having to go back to the contract or rate source.\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nUse the Opt In UI to enable this feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\nOffering:Project Financial ManagementâNo Longer Optional From:Update 25D\nAdditional steps:\nEnabling this feature is dependent on enabling the previously releasedBill Transaction Creation on Cost Importfeature. Please review the Release Readiness materials for that feature in full, as it does bring about some important changes to application behavior.\nWhen a user performs a status change action they can optionally provide a reason for the change. These \"action reasons\" are configured using the Manage Standard Lookups task in Setup and Maintenance, with one lookup type per bill transaction status:Lookup type code: ORA_PJB_BT_ACTION_STS_HOLD, Lookup meaning: Reason for changing bill transaction status to on holdLookup type code: ORA_PJB_BT_ACTION_STS_NONBIL, Lookup meaning: Reason for changing bill transaction status to nonbillableLookup type code: ORA_PJB_BT_ACTION_STS_READY, Lookup meaning: Reason for changing bill transaction status to ready\nLookup type code: ORA_PJB_BT_ACTION_STS_HOLD, Lookup meaning: Reason for changing bill transaction status to on hold\nLookup type code: ORA_PJB_BT_ACTION_STS_NONBIL, Lookup meaning: Reason for changing bill transaction status to nonbillable\nLookup type code: ORA_PJB_BT_ACTION_STS_READY, Lookup meaning: Reason for changing bill transaction status to ready\nThe existing profile option Unit of Measure for Invoice Lines Sent to Oracle Fusion Receivables (PJB_AR_INVOICE_UOM) must be configured as it is used as the default for bill transactions with amount-based pricing. Refer to the Important Concepts section under Tips & Considerations for more details.\nThe seeded data security policies controlling access to bill transactions for project managers rely on the user's project role being mapped to their job role (also known as enterprise role) in the Manage Project Roles task in Setup and Maintenance. This is not a change in this release, rather a reminder from the previously releasedBill Transaction and Exception Analysis Using Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (23B)feature.\n\n\n### Tips And Considerations\n\nImportant Concepts\nThe following concepts are important in understanding how the Bill Transactions page works, but also how the Bill Transaction business object has been shaped to standardize and simplify the user experience, to better support customer's needs:\nThe Bill Transactions page enables users to manage bill transactions that are applicable to external invoicing. The page is not designed to manage revenue-only transactions, or bill transactions related to intercompany or interproject billing.\nThe amount to bill of a bill transaction can always be expressed as a product of the bill quantity and unit price (rate). This rule applies irrespective of how the bill transaction was priced, for example, whether a bill rate was used, or a markup.\nTo support the above, the concept of a \"pricing type\" has been introduced (not currently visible in the UI), which governs whether users can perform actions to change the bill quantity, unit price, or the amount to bill. There are two pricing types currently supported:Quantity-based: The amount to bill is calculated by applying a unit price to a recorded quantity, denominated in a meaningful unit of measure. Examples include a bill transaction priced using a rate schedule with a bill rate, or an item-based billing event. Privileged users can change the quantity and/or the unit price of transactions with this pricing type.Amount-based: The amount to bill is either recorded directly, or a currency amount is attenuated by a multiplier or percentage. A recorded quantity is not used in the calculation of the amount to bill. Examples include a bill transaction priced using a rate schedule with a markup, or a non-item based billing event. Transactions priced on an amount basis have a quantity of \"1\", a default unit of measure (see Steps to Enable section), and the unit price is equal to the amount to bill. Privileged users can change the amount to bill of transactions with this pricing type, but not the quantity or unit price.\nQuantity-based: The amount to bill is calculated by applying a unit price to a recorded quantity, denominated in a meaningful unit of measure. Examples include a bill transaction priced using a rate schedule with a bill rate, or an item-based billing event. Privileged users can change the quantity and/or the unit price of transactions with this pricing type.\nAmount-based: The amount to bill is either recorded directly, or a currency amount is attenuated by a multiplier or percentage. A recorded quantity is not used in the calculation of the amount to bill. Examples include a bill transaction priced using a rate schedule with a markup, or a non-item based billing event. Transactions priced on an amount basis have a quantity of \"1\", a default unit of measure (see Steps to Enable section), and the unit price is equal to the amount to bill. Privileged users can change the amount to bill of transactions with this pricing type, but not the quantity or unit price.\nWhen a user changes the status of a bill transaction, behind the scenes these changes are synchronized with the source transactions (project costs or billing events) for backwards compatibility. The same applies to changes of the bill quantity or amount for bill transactions associated with billing events; the changes are synchronized back to the billing events. Conversely, changes to the bill transaction quantity are not synchronized back to project cost transactions. The reason being, cost quantity and bill quantity are considered as first class measurements on each respective business object, to give customers maximum flexibility. So whilst one may influence the other (for example, the cost quantity being used as the default for bill quantity), the two are not systematically locked together.\nRedwood pages typically use the same REST APIs that we make available to customers to build integrated or automation solutions. Therefore, actions to change a bill transaction status, quantity, unit price, and amount to bill are also available using REST API.\nFAQs\nCan I create browser bookmarks for the page?\nYes. Browser bookmarks are fully supported, and they include the current bill transaction search criteria. The URL structure can also be used for linking from other applications, such as OTBI. Here's an example of the page URL with all of the currently supported filters included:\nhttps://{{yourfusionurl.com}}/fscmUI/redwood/project-billing/bill-transactions/manage?billing_status=READY%7CON_HOLD&keywords=100106415011830&project_id=300100628624901&status_reason=PM_REVIEW_READY&transaction_date=2023-06-01%7C2024-08-31&transaction_type=10001\nCan I use the browser refresh button?\nYes, and search criteria are preserved through the URL. You can use browser refresh after taking an action to refresh data on the page.\nWhat's the symbol next to some currency amounts?\nIf the Invoice Currency or Contract Currency are different to the Transaction Currency, then currency conversion takes place (according to contract and application setups). If a displayed amount is the product of currency conversion, an icon next to the amount indicates that this has happened.\n\nThe Bill Transactions page showing the currency switcher and currency conversion indicator\nHow do I search on Transaction Number?\nYou do this using keyword search. Simply type the transaction number into the Smart Search box and hit return. Currently only the Transaction Number attribute is enabled for keyword search.\n\nThe Bill Transaction page showing a keyword search on Transaction Number.\nData Upgrade\nThe bill transaction business object has been taking shape over the last year or so. During this time we have added new properties to the business object, such as status, status reason and pricing type. Therefore, these properties will be blank (null) for historic transactions. Given that unbilled transactions typically have a relatively short lifecycle (where many customers bill monthly in arrears), this may not present an issue. Also, given that managing bill transactions is a new business process, it may also be beneficial to introduce the use of this UI for new projects only.\nHowever, if it is important to your business to query and manage historic bill transactions, then we have provided a facility for you to upgrade data. Please note that this is an irreversible process, so please ensure to run this in a non-production environment and reconcile the results. In order to run the data upgrade you must have opted in to theBill Transaction Creation on Cost Importfeature. You then need to run the Generate Invoices process with the following parameters:\nCreate Billing Transactions:No\nCreate Billing Transactions:No\nCreate Invoice:No\nCreate Invoice:No\nBilling Type:External\nSome FAQs on the data upgrade process:\nWhich parameters of the Generate Invoice process are honored when running in data upgrade mode?\nBusiness Unit, Contract Number, Contract Range, Bill From Date, Bill-Through Date. All other parameters are ignored. If the Bill From Date is left blank, then a default of 01-JAN-2023 is used.\nAre transactions associated with closed contracts included in the data upgrade?\nNo.\nHow are transactions identified as needing to be upgraded?\nWhere the billing status is blank.\nCan I run the data upgrade again for the same transactions?\nNot as standard. You'll need to contact Oracle Support.\nCan I reverse or undo the upgrade?\nNo.\nCurrent Limitations\nOur plan is to incrementally release value to customers, improving the user experience with every release, prioritized based on demand. Whilst we've packed as much as we can into this first release, there are sadly some elements that didn't make the cut such as action history and approvals. Look out for an upcoming post on Customer Connect where we explore some of these limitations in more detail, along with other FAQs.\nWhat's Next\nAs above, our plan is to incrementally release value and we're already working on the next enhancements to this user experience. However, we'd love to hear from you on Customer Connect to help us shape what comes next (one idea per feature please; this helps with the votes)!\nA couple of features planned for an upcoming release:\nManage bill transactions by exception by configuring rules which set the initial status and status reason of bill transactionsFor example, bill transactions are created with a status of \"On hold\", and a status reason of \"Needs review\".\nFor example, bill transactions are created with a status of \"On hold\", and a status reason of \"Needs review\".\nAbility to add more columns to the Data Grid\n\n\n### Key Resources\n\nThe Release Readiness materials for the following previously released features may provide additional useful context:Bill Transaction and Exception Analysis Using Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (23B)Project Contract Bill Transaction Retrieval Using a REST API (23B)Bill Transaction Creation on Cost Import (23C)Bill Transaction Creation on Billing Event Creation (23D)Additional Bill and Revenue Plan Analysis Using Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (23D)Bill Transaction Synchronization on Billing Event Update or Delete (24A)Work-in-Progress by Billing Status Analysis Using OTBI (24B)Improvements to Real-Time WIP Reporting (24C)\nBill Transaction and Exception Analysis Using Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (23B)\nProject Contract Bill Transaction Retrieval Using a REST API (23B)\nBill Transaction Creation on Cost Import (23C)\nBill Transaction Creation on Billing Event Creation (23D)\nAdditional Bill and Revenue Plan Analysis Using Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (23D)\nBill Transaction Synchronization on Billing Event Update or Delete (24A)\nWork-in-Progress by Billing Status Analysis Using OTBI (24B)\nImprovements to Real-Time WIP Reporting (24C)\n\n\n### Access Requirements\n\nThe bill transaction security architecture enables organizations to:\nCreate a read-only role to access the Bill Transactions page.\nAllow users to have read-only access to transactions in one data context (for example, Business Unit A), allow some actions on transactions in another data context (for example, Business Unit B), and other actions on transactions in another data context (for example, Business Unit C).\nKeep an eye out on Customer Connect for an upcoming post which takes a deeper dive into bill transaction security.\nControl access to the Bill Transactions page\nAssuming the opt-in for this feature is enabled, users must have the Manage Project Contract Bill Transaction (PJB_MANAGE_PROJECT_CONTRACT_BILL_TRANSACTION_PRIV) privilege to access the Bill Transactions page. Out of the box, this privilege is included in the following job/duty roles:\nProject Billing Specialist (ORA_PJF_PROJECT_BILLING_SPECIALIST_JOB)\nProject Management Duty (ORA_PJF_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_DUTY_ABSTRACT)\nGrants Accountant (ORA_PJF_GRANTS_ACCOUNTANT_JOB)\nGrants Administrator (ORA_PJF_GRANTS_ADMINISTRATOR_JOB)\nPrincipal Investigator (ORA_PJF_PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR_JOB)\nGrants Department Administrator (ORA_PJF_GRANTS_DEPARTMENT_ADMINISTRATOR_JOB)\nControl access to which transactions a user can query\nOut of the box, data security policies are defined for the action of viewing bill transactions. The same policies are used to control data access in OTBI. Additional policies can be created as needed using the Security Console.\nUsers can query transactions on which they hold an active project manager project role.\nNote that the seeded data security policy requires the job role (also known as enterprise role) to be mapped to the user's project role using the Manage Project Roles task in Setup and Maintenance.

It helps in risk assessment by highlighting potential issues, drawing attention to non-standard clauses, and distinguishing between favorable and unfavorable terms within the contract.\nTo classify each key term, you must define rules in Groovy and validate them beforehand. You have the flexibility to create your own classification codes, such as 'Standard,' 'Non-Standard,' 'Favorable,' 'Unfavorable,' 'Neutral,' and more. For instance, a potential rule for the renewal percentage key term could be:\nIf the renewal percentage exceeds 5, classify it as 'Favorable.'If the renewal percentage falls between 3 and 5, consider it 'Neutral.'If the percentage is below 3, classify it as 'Unfavorable.'\n\nClassifying key terms enables stakeholders to swiftly analyze the contract's critical elements, enabling them to make informed decisions.\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nUse the Opt In UI to enable this feature.

Record time on projects using Oracle Fusion Time and Labor, Oracle Fusion Projects, or third-party sources, and calculate the cost of the time transactions using distributed actual payroll costs. This payroll cost distribution method provides the most accurate costing of the labor effort on a project, allowing for efficient cost control and enhanced financial analysis. This new method extends the labor cost distribution capabilities in Project Costing, providing a time card based distribution option in addition to the existing person assignment and payroll cost configuration methods.\nThe following steps describe how to use the new time card distribution method for allocating payroll costs to projects:\nEnable the Distribute Using Time Cards option when creating a new person assignment labor schedule version. A distribution rule specifying time card distribution as the basis is automatically created.Labor Schedule Version Enabled For Time Card Distribution\nLabor Schedule Version Enabled For Time Card Distribution\nDefine the pay elements that you want to use when distributing costs from Oracle Fusion Payroll to projects and specify the new Time Card Distribution Basis for each. If you are importing payroll costs from third-party sources, you must specify the Time Card Distribution Basis for each payroll cost when loading into the interface table if these costs will be distributed to projects using the time card distribution method.Specify Which Target Time Cards Are Eligible For Each Pay Element Based on Expenditure Type Class\nSpecify Which Target Time Cards Are Eligible For Each Pay Element Based on Expenditure Type Class\nImport time cards into Project Costing from either Oracle Fusion Time and Labor, Oracle Fusion Projects, or a third-party time reporting source. The Import Costs process determines whether a time card transaction being imported is eligible to be recosted using distributed payroll actual costs. If it is, then the time card transaction is imported into Project Costing with a 0 cost rate, and its payroll costed status is Pending.Time Cards Pending Payroll Costing Have a Cost of 0NOTE:For a billable time card transaction, if the pricing method is based on cost, such as the case for the cost reimbursable method, then \"The transaction isn't billed because billing is based on raw or burdened cost that's zero. (PJB_ZERO_COST)\" billing exceptions will be raised for time cards that are pending payroll distribution when bill or revenue transactions are created. Consider setting these transactions to Nonbillable or placing a billing or revenue hold on them until they are successfully costed using distributed payroll actual costs in order to prevent or remove the undesired PJB_ZERO_COST billing exceptions.\nTime Cards Pending Payroll Costing Have a Cost of 0\nNOTE:For a billable time card transaction, if the pricing method is based on cost, such as the case for the cost reimbursable method, then \"The transaction isn't billed because billing is based on raw or burdened cost that's zero.

Otherwise, load externally-sourced payroll costs into the interface table.\nSchedule the Import Payroll Costs process to distribute the payroll as defined. For time card distribution, all payroll costs for a specific person assignment in the payroll period are summarized by time card distribution basis. The target time cards in Project Costing are identified, and the total amount that each target transaction should receive is calculated, and each transaction is then recosted using a newDistribute payroll costsadjustment type.Imported Payroll Costs Successfully Distributed to Time CardsTarget Time Cards After Payroll Cost Distribution\nImported Payroll Costs Successfully Distributed to Time Cards\n\nTarget Time Cards After Payroll Cost Distribution\nFurther planned enhancements for this feature include:\nOption to exclude time cards that are pending payroll cost distribution from the invoicing and revenue recognition processes when the pricing method of the transaction is based on cost.\nDisplayed time card distribution results for a processed labor cost in the Manage Labor Costs user interface and in an API.\nOption to calculate a provisional cost for a time card transaction using standard costing prior to the distribution of actual payroll costs.\nAbility to define time card distribution schedules at a higher level than person assignment, such as by department or business unit.\n\nThis feature offers the following business benefits:\nIncreased profitability through enhanced financial analysis provided by the most accurate costing of the labor effort expended on a project.\nAbility to make better-informed decisions based on the more accurate labor costs recorded on a project.\nElimination of labor schedule distribution rule maintenance, leading to time and cost savings. Using time card distribution, payroll costs are dynamically allocated to the projects on which a person worked using the person's reported time.\nHere's the demo of these capabilities:\n\n\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nYou don't need to do anything to enable this feature.\n\n\n### Tips And Considerations\n\nThe time card distribution method can be configured only for person assignment labor shedules.\nUpdate your existing pay elements in Labor Distribution with a Time Card Distribution Basis value if these pay elements will be used to distribute payroll costs to projects using time cards.\nPayroll costs are distributed to the time cards that exist in Project Costing when the Import Payroll Costs process is executed. Therefore, ensure that all time cards within the payroll period date range have been imported into Project Costing prior to running the Import Payroll Costs process.\nUse the Cost Distribution Payroll Costed Indicator subledger accounting source in your rules for the Labor Cost and Labor Cost Adjustment event classes if you need to account for labor costs differently based on costs calculated using standard costing or payroll costing.\nAll payroll costs to be distributed to a time card transaction must have the same currency.\nThe payroll cost distribution to time cards is tracked using a newDistribute payroll costsproject cost adjustment type. The Allow Adjustments configuration setting on the document entry of a third-party transaction source is not considered when distributing payroll costs to time cards. TheAdjust transactionssetting on a project status action control, however, is considered when distributing payroll costs to time cards. If a project's current status is configured to not allow transaction adjustments, then the payroll cost distribution adjustments to target time card transactions on that project will fail.\nThe method for distributing payroll costs to time cards involves calculating an overall cost rate across all payroll pay element costs targeting a particular time card transaction, and then multiplying that rate by the transaction's quantity to calculate the raw cost amount. Raw cost amounts are not rounded on the transaction records in the database, however, the raw cost amounts are rounded to the precision of the transaction's currency when displayed in the Manage Project Costs page or when generating accounting for the time card transaction.\nIf the time card quantities change in Project Costing after a successful distribution of payroll costs, such as by importing a new time card transaction that meets the payroll distribution eligibility criteria, then the status of the relevant labor cost records in Labor Distribution is updated to Needs Reprocesing. You can redistribute payroll costs to the revised set of target time cards using one of the Process Costs options in the Manage Labor Costs page.\n\n\n### Key Resources\n\nTo understand how this new feature fits into the overall scope of payroll cost distribution, review the related help:Labor Distribution section of the Using Project Costing guide.\nLabor Distribution section of the Using Project Costing guide.\nBased on Idea763509from the Project Management Idea Lab and Idea673210from the Payroll, Compensation and Benefits Idea Lab on Oracle Cloud Customer Connect.\n\n\n### Access Requirements\n\nNo new access requirements.",

For rate-based resources such as a consultant, the amounts are automatically calculated using the rate settings defined in the financial project plan settings. Optionally, override the amounts by entering both the quantity and cost or revenue amounts.\n\nAdd project plan impact details page\nAfter the change order is approved and moved to the implementation stage, select theImplement and Mark Completeaction to include the financial amount impacts. This action will add the financial impacts to the planned quantity and amounts of the financial project plan. Note that these amounts are editable from the Manage Financial Project Plan page.\n\nImplement and mark complete action to include changes in the financial project plan\nBusiness analysts can now leverageOracle Transactional Business Intelligence (OTBI)to generate detailed reports on project plan impacts. This enables users to analyze key financial metrics, such as thecumulative cost and revenue impactof pending change orders, broken down by tasks or resources within a project. With enhanced visibility, decision-makers can proactively assess financial risks and opportunities associated with project changes.Additionally, users cancreate, view, update, or deleteproject plan impact details using theChange Impact Details RESTresource, providing greater flexibility and automation in your existing change management integration solutions.\n\nBusiness benefits of using this feature are:\nImprovement in project profitability and cost control by preventing margin erosion and project disruptions. Effective change management ensures every modification is assessed for its impact, keeping the project plan on track and optimized.\nReduction in administrative overhead in keeping project plans up to date by automatically including change order impacts, allowing teams to focus on high-value activities.\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nUse the Opt In UI to enable this feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\nOffering:Project Financial ManagementâNo Longer Optional From:Update 26B\nThe feature opt-in choice is set toYesby default, making it ready for immediate use. If additional time is needed before activating this feature, you have the option to set the Opt-in choice toNo. This feature will be always enabled from update 26B.\n\n\n### Tips And Considerations\n\nAs a best practice, create a baseline of the project plan after implementing a change order that impacts it. This ensures better progress tracking and also allows you to automatically generate a new version of the budget.\n\n\n### Key Resources\n\nThis feature extends the change order impact assessment capability, first introduced for budgets in 24A asChange Order Automation for Project Budget Adjustments, to the Financial Project Plan.\n\n\n### Access Requirements\n\nTo use this feature you need these privileges:\nManage Project Changes (PJE_MANAGE_PROJECT_CHANGE_PRIV) to create a change order, perform impact assessment, review, approve, and implement a change order.\nManage Project Task Structure (PJF_MANAGE_PROJECT_TASK_STRUCTURE_DATA) to automatically implement a change order with project plan impacts.",

            "content": "# Variable Weekly Schedules for Project Resource Assignments\nDefine detailed weekly schedules when directly assigning a labor resource to a project. Resource managers set precise weekly allocations without the need for a formal resource request and allocate team members based on real-time project demands. Adjust multiple resource assignment schedule hours or switch between variable weekly hours and other scheduling methods to reflect the latest schedule demands. Replace resources on variable weekly hour assignments to address availability and workload balance.\n\nCreate Assignments for Variable Weekly Hours\n\nAdjust Multiple Assignments\n\nReplace Resources Scheduled with Variable Weekly Hours\n\nThese are the business benefits of this feature:\nReduced Administrative Overheadâ Directly assigning resources to variable weekly assignments eliminates the need for formal resource requests and streamlines the assignment process.\nIncreased Agilityâ Efficient adjustments to assignment schedules enables quick response to changing demands.\nImproved Project Efficiencyâ Aligns resource planning with project schedules, minimizing downtime and delays.\nFaster Response to Availability Changesâ Quickly replacing resources avoids disruptions and keeps projects on track.\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nYou don't need to do anything to enable this feature.\n\n\n### Tips And Considerations\n\nAdditional capabilities under consideration for upcoming updates include:Creating and adjusting variable weekly assignments in the Manage Resource Schedules Gantt chart.Mass creation of direct assignments for a project with variable weekly hours schedules.Plan resources with variable weekly schedules in project management.\nCreating and adjusting variable weekly assignments in the Manage Resource Schedules Gantt chart.\nMass creation of direct assignments for a project with variable weekly hours schedules.\nPlan resources with variable weekly schedules in project management.\nWhen adjusting an assignment with variable weekly hours, the assignment hours will shift based on the changes that are made to the assignment start and finish dates and duration:\nStart Date\nEarlier\nShift the existing weekly hours based on the new start date.\nShift the existing weekly hours based on the new start date.\nShift the existing weekly hours earlier based on the new start date. For additional weeks in the longer duration, set the weekly hours equal to the default weekly hours value.\nRemove hours for dates no longer part of the assignment. Keep existing weekly hours that were set on remaining weeks of assignment.\nRemove hours for dates no longer part of the assignment. Keep existing daily hours that were set on remaining dates of assignment.\nRemove hours for dates no longer part of the assignment. Keep existing daily hours that were set on remaining dates of assignment.\nShift existing hours to start at new start date, add the default weekly hours for each additional week to the end of the assignment for additional weeks added to the duration.\nShift existing hours starting at the new start date. Remove hours at the end for weeks no longer within the new duration.\n\n\n### Key Resources\n\nThis feature extends the variable weekly hours scheduling capabilities, first introduced in 25A asVariable Weekly Resource Schedules for Project Resource Requests, to the creation of direct assignments in Project Resource Management.\n\n\n### Access Requirements\n\nNo new access requirements.\n\n\n| Start Date | Finish Date | Duration | Assignment Hours Change |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Earlier | Earlier | Same | Shift the existing weekly hours based on the new start date. |\n| Later | Later | Same | Shift the existing weekly hours based on the new start date. |\n| Earlier | No change | Longer | Shift the existing weekly hours earlier based on the new start date.
