If a feature has already been enabled, you will see a check mark. Otherwise, you will see an icon to enable the feature.\nClick the icon in theEnabledcolumn and complete the steps to enable the feature.\nFor more information and detailed instructions on opting in to new features for your offering, seeConfigure Offerings.\nOpt In Expiration\nOccasionally, features delivered Disabled via Opt In may be enabled automatically in a future update. This is known as an Opt In Expiration. If your cloud service has any Opt In Expirations in this update, you will see a related tab in this document. Click on that tab to see when the feature was originally delivered Disabled, and when the Opt In will expire, potentially automatically enabling the feature. You can alsoclick hereto see features with current Opt In Expirations across all Oracle Cloud Applications. Beyond the current update, the Financials forums on Cloud Customer Connect have details of Opt In Expirations upcoming in future updates.",

Additionally, an option to derive partner details from the message payloads is now available.\nNo specific configuration other than an active connection is required for processing inbound messages that are in response to an outbound message. For example, PO Acknowledgments, PO based invoices, and shipments.\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nUse the Opt In UI to enable this feature.

            "content": "# Transfer Asset to Another Book across ledgers\nTransfer assets from one book to another and generate intercompany entries between the two books when required. Descriptive and depreciation details are moved to the newly transferred asset automatically for continuity and audit.\nThis feature enables you to seamlessly transfer a fixed asset from one entity, location, or employee to another, across different asset books. Both the originating (source) and receiving (destination) books must be part of the same ledger through release 25B. From release 25C onwards the asset books can be part of different ledgers. The valuation, depreciation rules, and other specifics of the destination asset are governed by the transaction rules you specify.\nThe application generates independently balanced accounting entries in the source book to close out asset balances, and a separate set of balanced entries in the destination book to initiate the opening balances.\nThis process automates the recording of intercompany entries for transfers involving different balancing segment values, eliminating the need for manual General Ledger entries. By doing so, it reduces the burden of manually reconciling these entries in Oracle Assets.\nOnly the Net book value method transfer type is allowed for transfers across ledgers, because this asset transfer is treated as a related party sale.\nIn this case, the transfer is documented as a specific book transfer retirement transaction in the source book and as a unique transfer-in addition in the destination book.\nDuring the transfer, you can use the following cost basis types to determine the cost and accumulated depreciation in the destination book.\nCost and reserve of the source asset: The destination asset balances are initialized with the cost and reserve amount of the source asset.\nNet book value of the source asset: The destination asset cost is initialized with the net book value of the source asset. The depreciation reserve is initialized to zero.\nTransfer amount: The destination asset cost is initialized with a user-entered transfer amount. The depreciation reserve is initialized to zero.\nTo transfer multiple assets to another book, use the Fixed Asset Mass Transfer Import file-based data import template or Transfer Asset to Another Book integrated spreadsheet.\nCurrency Conversion\nWhen transferring an asset between primary books with different currencies, you must provide a currency conversion rate to convert the amount from the source bookâs currency to the destination bookâs currency.\nConversion Rate Type: Select a rate type defined in General Ledger.\nConversion Rate: Enter a rate if the rate type is User.\nWhen the destination bookâs ledger uses the same reporting currency as the source book ledger, the Reporting Currency Rate Basis can be one of the following:-\nUse historical rate â Source book reporting currency amount is copied  to destination book.\nUse rate as of transfer date â Conversion rate on the transfer date is used to convert the source book reporting currency amount to the destination book.\nWhen the destination bookâs ledger has a different reporting currency than the source book ledger, the Reporting Currency Rate Basis must be âUse rate as of transfer dateâ.\nEnter the following details to calculate the cost.\nConversion Rate Type: Select the rate type defined in General Ledger.\nConversion Rate: Enter this rate if the rate type is User.\nReporting Currency Rate Basis: Enter this rate to specify how the reporting currency amount is calculated for the destination book.\n\nSubledger Rules and Accounting\nConfigurable Oracle Subledger Accounting (SLA) rules and mapping sets allow you to customize your intercompany journal line rules for the transfer between books transactions. A new predefined journal entry rule set is available for the Book Transfer event class, which has Intercompany Receivables and Intercompany Payables journal lines. The natural accounts for these can be setup as AR Intercompany account and AP Intercompany account in the source and destination book setup. You need to use either the CSV Export and Import or Book Setup REST API to enter both of these accounts.\nAccounting Example\nIn this example, the asset Asset was transferred with a cost basis of Net book value of the source asset. The original cost of the asset was $22,000.00, with depreciation reserve of $ 5866.67 and the net book value of $ 16,133.33. This asset was transferred from company 3241 to company 4305\nSource Book Accounting\nAccounted Debit (USD)\nAccounted    Credit (USD)\n3241-000-41210-0000-0000\nDestination Book Accounting\nThe asset in the destination book was created with a cost of $16133.33 cost and zero reserve using Net book value of the source asset as the cost basis. The intercompany segment was populated to 3241 to indicate the source entity.\nAccounted Debit                     (USD)\nAccountedCredit                               (USD)\n\nThe business benefit includes:\nStreamlines asset management by seamlessly transferring assets between books, either within the same ledger or across different ledgers.\nGenerates Intercompany entries automatically.\nEnsures continuity and accuracy by transferring descriptive and depreciation details to the newly transferred asset, eliminating the need for manual retirement and addition transactions in separate books.\nEnhances efficiency, reduces errors, and supports smoother audit trails.\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nUse the Opt In UI to enable this feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\nOffering:FinancialsâNo Longer Optional From:Update 26A\nUse the opt-in for Fixed Assets Transfer Between Asset Books in Financials to enable this feature. From release 26A the feature will be no longer optional to enable.\nOffering:FinancialsNo Longer Optional From:Update 26A\nUse the opt-in forFixed Assets Transfer Between Asset Booksin Financials to enable this feature.\nSetup and Maintenance > Financials > Change Feature Opt In > Fixed Assets> Edit Feature >Fixed Assets Transfer Between Asset Booksfeature in Financials.\n\nSetup and Maintenance-> Manage Asset Books ->  Enable the ' Allow transfer to another book' option\n\nEnable the lookup to transfer asset across ledgers\nIn Setup and Maintenance, search and go to the  \"Manage Standard Lookups\" task.\nSearch for the lookup type - 'ORA_ERP_CONTROLLED_CONFIG'.\nEnter \"FA_37408007\" as the lookup code.\n\n\n\n### Tips And Considerations\n\nTo continue with the source assetâs life and depreciation rules, donât select the âInherit depreciation rules of destination category\" option.\nIn the source book, there is no gain or loss when the asset is transferred at net book value. A gain or loss occurs only if the asset is transferred at an amount different from its net book value.\nThe Periodic Mass Copy process doesn't copy the asset transfer between books transaction in the corporate book to the tax book and must be entered individually in each of the tax books.\nIf the source corporate book has more tax books than the destination book, you must manually retire the asset in the tax books that don't have a corresponding destination book. Conversely, if the destination book has tax books without a matching source book, you must perform a direct asset addition in those destination tax books.\nIf the number of reporting currency books isnât the same in the source and destination books, use the Net book value method transfer type.\nUse the conversion rate to convert the transfer amount, freight , nonrecoverable tax , and miscellaneous amounts in the source book to the destination book. You can't enter the destination transfer amount, freight , non recoverable tax , and miscellaneous amounts in the destination book directly. The Destination Transfer Amount, Destination Freight Amount, Destination Nonrecoverable Tax Amount, and Destination Miscellaneous Amount columns(Columns AE to AH) in Book Transfer worksheet of the Fixed Asset Mass Transfers file-based data import template are for future use.\nOnly full transfer of assets is allowed and partial transfers aren't allowed.\nYou canât transfer a group asset to another book. You can transfer member assets only after they are removed from the group asset and become standalone assets. You can then transfer the standalone asset in the source book to the destination book.\n\n\n### Key Resources\n\nThis feature originated from the Idea Labs on Oracle Cloud Customer Connect: Idea540334\nTransfer Asset to Another Book  (Doc IDKB177590)\n\n\n### Access Requirements\n\nThe predefined Asset Accountant and Asset Accounting Manager job roles have access to this feature.

Prompts are the instructions you provide to generative AI agents. Customizing prompts is an advanced feature and entirely optionalâintended only for situations where your specific needs go beyond the seeded prompts.\nTo do prompt customization, you need to use the AI Configurator, a component function of the HCM Experience Design Studio. It provides customers the ability to override the default prompt functionality delivered by Fusion Applications.  FollowAdministration Interface to Manage Prompts Used for Generative AI Features.\nStep 1, users will need to access either an existing sandbox or they will need to create a new sandbox. To access the sandbox management page, click the hamburger icon and select Configuration > Sandboxes. The sandbox must have the HCM Experience Design Studio tool deployed in the sandbox.\nStep 2-3, enter the sandbox and start the HCM Experience Design Studio using the Tools drop down. Click on the AI Configurator menu option.\nStep 4, AI Configurator page opens. The page has two sections.Overridden Prompts â currently overridden prompts.Seeded Prompts â prompts that are available for configuring.\nOverridden Prompts â currently overridden prompts.\nSeeded Prompts â prompts that are available for configuring.\nStep 5, you can locate the Expenses Policy Agent prompt with Prompt label: financials.exm.expense_policy_inquiry_agent_prompt\nStep 6: When you locate the prompt, click the down arrow to show the details of the prompt or click the Override prompt icon on the right of the prompt entry. The Override Prompt drawer opens for edit.\nStep 7: You can make changes to the prompt and use a Touchless Expenses user to test those changes. Once satisfied with the changes, you can Save the prompt. The prompt will now be listed in the Overridden Prompts section of the app. When the Touchless Expenses user uses the Expenses Policy Agent, the overriding prompt will be executed in place of the seeded prompt.\nStep 8: To make updates or remove the override, click the ellipsis and select Edit or Delete. Once the prompt is deleted, the Oracle delivered seeded prompt will be used.\nStep 9: Exit the sandbox once your changes have been committed in the AI Configurator.\nNOTE:\nLines beginning with #'s are instructions or locations for variables.\nPrompt variables are enclosed in curly braces {variable_name}. They are integral to the prompts function.\nReview allprompt customization tips and considerationsof the prompt customization guide before you make any updates.\nSample prompts for common scenarios:\n##User ContextUser Job Name: {user_jobname}User Location:  {user_location}\n## ReferencesContext: {context}\n## InstructionsUsing the context, answer the following question: {user_query}\n## Acceptance CriteriaProvide a concise and direct answer in 1-2 sentences.\nExplain why your answer is correct by citing the original context.Do not mention the user context if it is not relevant to the answer.\nIn the seeded pompt, there are 2 variables with user context.

            "content": "# Redwood: Validate Supplier Bank Accounts\nAccurate bank account information is critical to successful procurement operations. Fraudulent bank accounts lead to payment fraud with monetary losses and increased costs to correct, track, and attempt funds recovery. Even legitimate suppliers that incorrectly enter bank account information can cause expensive transaction errors.\nYou can now validate supplier bank accounts in supplier registration with a third-party service to ensure the bank account is valid and that the owner of the bank account matches the supplier. Validating the supplier bank accounts in supplier registration will reduce the risk of payment fraud, improve transaction efficiency, reduce approval cycle time, and lower operational costs associated with invalid or incorrect bank account information.\nIn this feature, supplier bank accounts are validated through a seamless integration to JP Morgan's Bank Account Validation Service (AVS) after the supplier registration is submitted with the results presented in the registration approval notification. The AVS service checks the following:\nBank account validityto ensure it exists and is valid, and\nBank account ownervalidityto confirm that the bank account belongs to the supplier being registered.\nThe validation status includes the validation outcome of both the bank account and the bank account owner. Based on both outcomes, a final status and supporting message is displayed to the approvers. The bank account validation status is saved and shown on the supplier profile after the registration request is approved.\nThe bank account validation statuses include:\nVerified:Confirms that the bank account is open, valid, and the supplier is the account owner.\nFailed: Confirms either the bank account is invalid or closed for payment transactions, or the bank account is open and valid, but supplier isn't the account owner.\nInconclusive: Indicates the bank account isn't found and can't be validated, or the account owner can't be validated.\n\n\nBank Account Validation Status Displayed on Supplier Registration Approval Notification\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nUse the Opt In UI to enable this feature. For instructions, refer to the Optional Uptake of New Features section of this document.\nOffering:Procurement\nThis feature is available through a paid subscription with JPMorgan. It requires a JPMorgan bank account for billing purposes. The account must have been opened with any JPMorgan branch in United States.

The feature works for external as well as internal supplier registrations.\n\n\n### Tips And Considerations\n\nThe bank accounts are revalidated when requesters resubmit registration requests returned by approvers, ensuring approvers have the latest validation status in case the bank accounts are changed.\nThe bank account validation status is informational only and doesn't prevent payment processing to the supplier bank account. Approvers should take appropriate actions when reviewing bank accounts that didn't pass verification in supplier registration.\nThe bank account validation service is planned for supplier profile change requests in a future update.\nJPMorgan's AVS supports validation of:supplier bank accounts based in the US and select non-US countries.

            "title": "Integrated Banking and Payments with Bank of America",
            "content": "# Integrated Banking and Payments with Bank of America\nEmbedded banking services with Bank of America (BofA) provide businesses with a comprehensive view of their cash position, payments, and receipts. The solution includes ready to use connectivity between Oracle and BofA for customers with accounts domiciled in U.S. and Canada. It includes rapid bank account onboarding, seeded ISO payment templates, automated funds capture and disbursement transmission, and continuous bank statement retrieval, processing, and reconciliation. The Banking Configurations functional area supports enablement of the following business flows:\nConnectivity, Bank and Bank Accounts\nFunds Disbursement\nFunds Capture\nBank Statement Processing\nConnectivity, Bank and Bank Accounts\nOracle B2B generates PGP and SSH key pairs for the customer, stores the private keys securely, and emails the public keys to the customer with instructions to share them with Bank of America (BofA). The customer downloads and forwards the keys to BofA, which loads and configures them, then notifies the customer upon setup completion.\nThe turnkey bank onboarding uses a BofA-specific template to create the banks, bank branches, and bank accounts. Through the integration, you can upload the BofA-specific template and create the banks, bank branches, and bank accounts. Once the bank accounts are created, the process automatically attaches the business functions and business units, reconciliation configurations, and bank statement transaction creation rules needed for payables and receivables processing. Users can review the onboarded bank accounts from the bell notifications. The Banks and Bank Accounts flow reduces setup steps by creating bank account master data that has been identified with BofA.  This flow can be used for initial and ongoing bank account creation.\nFunds Disbursement\nProcess payment and acknowledgment files for funds disbursement using the integration with BofA. Customers can generate and transmit payment files in the standard ISO template configured with BofA and retrieve and process disbursement acknowledgment files. Bank transfers and ad hoc payments can also be processed as part of this integration.\nThe integration uses the BofA message format based on ISO 20022 CGI standards. This format includes payments by ACH, Wire, and check for the US and Canada. The integration provides the acknowledgment processing feature with complete automation for file retrieval and processing. It processes file-level and transaction-level acknowledgment files generated by BofA at various points in the clearing flow. The invoice status changes from Paid to Unpaid for rejected payments, allowing users to take corrective action.\nFunds Capture - Lockbox\nProcess intraday lockbox using the integration with BofA to enable near real-time customer balances. Payment advice and remittance information are collated and combined with the lockbox file, eliminating the need for manual entry and application.\nBank Statement Processing\nProcess and reconcile bank statements using the automated integration with BofA. This maximizes efficiency and eliminates time-consuming activities through automatic bank statement processing and reconciliation.\nThe integration uses the BofA CAMT053 bank statement template, based on ISO20022 standards. The use of this template enables seamless bank statement file retrieval and processing. Features include:\nRegular retrieval and processing of prior day bank statements.\nAutomatic creation of new bank statement transaction codes reported on bank statement lines.\nAutomatic creation of bank statement transaction creation rules and reconciliation of bank statement lines.\nAutomatic unreconciliation and voiding of rejected payments, and reconciliation of the original and rejected bank statement lines.\nAutomatic reversal of rejected direct debit transactions and reconciliation of reversal bank statement lines.\nThe integration between Oracle and BofA eliminates weeks of technical integration work during implementation and enables transactional processing in Cloud ERP by directly connecting with BofA. Users have the flexibility to enable one or more flows.\n\nThese are the business benefits:\nConnectivity, Bank and Bank Accounts\nReduced effort involved in initial connectivity, security keys configuration and future renewal of expired keys using the BofA preconfigured connectivity.\nReduced effort in troubleshooting connectivity issues related to outbound and inbound file transmissions.\nImproves the customer experience with a unified and simplified UI, along with guided navigation.\nMaximizes efficiency and eliminates time-consuming activities through enabling the business functions, reconciliation configurations for these bank accounts.\nFunds Disbursement\nSimplify the entire setup process with predefined setups needed to generate the payment files in accordance with BofA's specifications.\nReduce effort and increase productivity through automated retrieval and processing of multiple acknowledgment files generated at different intervals for payment files.\nImprove efficiency by reducing manual steps and enabling immediate corrective actions for rejected payments.\nReduce effort related to payment file testing by using the BofA preferred format.\nFunds Capture - Lockbox\nImprove efficiency by eliminating a material amount of manual processing.\nReduce effort related to testing lockbox processing by using the BofA preferred format.\nBank Statement Processing\nEliminate manual configuration of BofA-specific bank statement formats and other bank statement processing configurations through seamless integration.\nAutomate retrieval and processing of bank statement files.\nProvide automatic reconciliation of bank statement lines and notification of exceptions, if any.\n\n\n### Steps to Enable\n\nTo enable this feature you need to log a Service Request (SR).\nConnectivity\nPrerequisite Steps\nBefore embedding banking services with BofA in Cloud ERP, you must first work with a BofA implementation team to establish the bank accounts and the related scope of the services you want to include. Please contact your BofA Sales/Relationship manager.\nIf your enterprise is new to Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP and has not completed the implementation process, please review Getting Started with Your Financials Implementation before enabling the banking integration with BofA.\nEmbedded banking services with BofA is currently in controlled availability and requires a promotion code.\nTo enable this feature, you need to log a Service Request (SR) using Product: Oracle Fusion Payments Cloud Service and Problem Type: Setup and Configuration - Payables.  You will need to provide the production and test environment names.  Once the above is completed, follow the steps in the Service Request to enable embedded banking services with BofA, including the following setup steps to enable the connectivity between BofA and Cloud ERP.\nIn the Banking Configurations functional area, click Manage Embedded Banking Configurations.\n\nSelect BofA from the list and select the business flows that you want to enable. Click Next.\n\nAfter clicking âNextâ on the page, below steps are executed by B2B.\nKey Generation: Oracle initiates the process of generating PGP and SSH key pair exclusively for the customer.\nKey Sharing: Oracle shares the public keys with the customer via email during enablement, and the customer then forwards them to the partner through secure email. The private keys are securely stored within Oracle B2B vault.\nKey Naming: The SSH and PGP files are named with a suffix that matches the Oracle customerâs environment name.\nAn email is sent to the customer with instructions to share the keys with BofA.\nStatus changes to In Progress, indicating that key sharing has been requested.\nCustomer downloads the SSH and PGP keys.\nShares them with Bank of America via secure email.\nBofA loads the keys, configures them.\nBofA notifies the customer once the setup is complete.\nBanks and Bank Accounts\nThe banks, bank branches and bank accounts are configured using the BofA specific bank account template. Once the bank accounts are configured, the reconciliation configurations are automatically attached to these bank accounts.\nUpload Banks, Branches and Accounts\n\nReview Bell Notification\n\nFunds Disbursement\nThis feature is automatically enabled after you onboard using the Manage Embedded Banking Configurations task. This feature lets you use the following preconfigured setups:\nPayment System Account: BOFA_PSA\nPayment Process Profile: BOFA ISO20022 CGI\nPayment Method: BOFA EFT Payment Method (for ACH and Wire payments)\nPayment Method: BOFA Check Payment Method (for check payments)\nAs part of the integration with BofA you can also create payment files using the predefined BIP template BOFA ISO20022 CGI in the BofA CGI format.\nEnsure that supplier who are planning to be paid through BofA bank account are updated with BofA payment method, delivery channel and service level.\nBefore you can use the acknowledgment flow, you must review the following settings at the payment system account level.\nDisbursement Acknowledgment Automatic Voiding Option\nDisbursement Acknowledgment Voiding Invoice Action\nFunds Capture â Lockbox\nThis feature is automatically enabled after you onboard using the Manage Embedded Banking Configurations task. This feature includes the following preconfigured setups:\nAutoMatch Rule Set:  ORA_Automatch 90%\nAutoCash Rule Set:  ORA_Invoice Match\nReceivables Activities: ORA_Unearned Discount and ORA_Earned Discount\nReceipt Class and Method:  ORA_LOCKBOX\nReceipt Sources\nUse the following setup steps to enable Lockbox processing:\nIf lockbox processing is in scope for your funds capture flow, you must enter the required account code combinations in the specified fields of the Default Accounting for Lockbox Receipts section in the Cash Processing tabbed region of the Receivables System Options page for each applicable business unit. Entering this account information will automate the related lockbox setup during bank account onboarding. This is only required for a new lockbox setup.\nThe lockbox feature includes a predefined AutoMatch Rule Set and AutoCash Rule Set.  Enter these predefined rule sets either in the lockbox transmission or your Receivables System Options definition, as required. You also need to enable AutoApply in Receivables System Options and lockbox. See Tips and Considerations for more information about the predefined AutoMatch Rule Set and AutoCash Rule Set.\nTask - Manage Receivables System Options\n\nAfter your bank accounts are onboarded, use the Manage Receivables Activities page to review the two Receivables Activities that were created for each business unit: Unearned Discounts (ORA_Unearned Discount) and Earned Discounts (ORA_Earned Discount).\nTask - Manage Receivables Activities\n\nUse the Edit Receipt Classes and Methods page to review the receipt method, ORA_Lockbox, created for lockbox processing. Remittance bank accounts are added to this receipt method according to your setup and the bank accounts onboarded.\nUse the Manage Receipt Sources page to review the receipt sources created for lockbox processing. Receipt sources are created using the remittance bank account assignments in the ORA_Lockbox receipt method.\nAfter reviewing all the related lockbox setup as indicated in the previous steps, use the Create/Edit Lockbox page to manually configure a lockbox for your bank account using the receipt source, receipt method, and AutoMatch rule set provided.\nNOTE: If document sequencing is enabled for the applicable Ledger or Legal Entity, the related receipt processing document sequencing is set up automatically.\nBank Statement Processing\nThis feature is automatically enabled after you onboard using the Manage Embedded Banking Configurations for task for BofA. This feature lets you use the following preconfigured setups:\nManage Bank Statement Transaction Codes\nManage Bank Statement Transaction Creation Rules\nManage Bank Statement Reconciliation Tolerance Rules\nManage Bank Statement Reconciliation Matching Rules\nManage Bank Statement Reconciliation Rule Sets\nManage Formats\nManage Payment Systems\n\n\n### Tips And Considerations\n\nConnectivity\nRead the descriptions mentioned under the business flows to understand any pending setups to be reviewed and completed for the flow to be enabled.\nThe Banks and Bank Accounts business flow will be automatically selected for enablement when you enable the Funds Disbursement, Funds Capture, or Bank Statement Processing flows.\nIn order to see Business Intelligence reports related to this integration, assign the BI Administrator role to any user who needs to view them.\nBell notifications with detailed messages are generated as processing occurs.  If the enablement of a business flow doesn't complete, you receive a bell notification. Revisit the Manage Embedded Banking Configuration task to retry the process after 24 hours.  If the issue still persists, reach out to Oracle Support for assistance.\n\nBanks and Bank Accounts\nIf you notice any issues with the bank account onboarding process, review the related setups in your Cloud ERP instance for possible mismatched or missing legal entity names, legal entities, business units, or other enterprise structures.\nFunds Disbursement\nUse NURG as the service level code and delivery channel code as CCD, CCP, CTX, PPD, PPP and IAT for ACH transactions.\nUse URGP as the service level code for wire and cross-border transactions.\nUse CHK as the payment method alias for check payments.\nIn the payment file, the Service Level Alias Value is sent as SvcLvl. The service levels are predefined with codes NURG, URGP, and so on. Use NURG for ACH and URGP for wire payments.\nUsers can create their own payment process profile, but must use the preconfigured transmission setup related to this integration.\nFor any transmission issues with outbound or inbound files, log a service request.\nThe Bank of America (BofA) provides four levels of payment acknowledgment files during the clearing process, identified by file names containing L1, L2, L3 and L4:\nL1 â Performs file-level syntax validation within CashPro.\nL2 â Conducts additional payment validations; statuses are typically returned in a single file within seconds.\nL3 â Provides FX rate information and clearing details, if available; delivered at the end of a 2-hour window.\nL4 â Sent within 2 hours or once all items are processed, whichever comes first. Currently available only for APAC customers.\nL3 and L4 files are distributed at the end of the 2-hour clearing window and currently apply only to FX and wire payments.\nOnce payment file processing is completed, the status of the payment file changes to \"Completed and pending acknowledgment\".\nAcknowledgment file is automatically processed, and the payment file status changes to \"Acknowledged\" or \"Rejected\" depending on whether the bank accepts all, some, or none of the payments. At the same time, the payment status changes to \"Acknowledged\" or \"Rejected\" depending on whether the bank accepts or rejects the payment.\nUsers can configure the system to automatically void payments that have been rejected by the bank. Users can also configure the system to take automated action on the invoice to cancel or hold it when the payment is voided due to bank rejections.\nThis table summarizes the payment file and payment status after each step in acknowledgment processing:\nPayment File Status\nPayment Status\n(IBY_PAYMENTS_ALL)\nPayment Status\n(AP_CHECKS_ALL)\nFile Level â File accepted\nAcknowledged\nAcknowledged\nNegotiable\nFile Level â Rejected\nRejected\nRejected / Voided\nNegotiable/Voided\nTransaction Level â All payments accepted\nAcknowledged\nAcknowledged\nNegotiable\nTransaction Level â Some payments rejected\nAcknowledged\nRespective payments are changed to rejected / voided status\nNegotiable/Voided\nFunds Capture â Lockbox\nThe ORA_BAI2-EXTENDED_GENERIC/arlockboximportgenbai2 is the only supported lockbox transmission format for BofA integration. This format uses the control file arlockboximportgenbai2.ctl.\nBefore you initiate bank account onboarding for lockbox, verify that the fields in the Default Accounting for Lockbox Receipts section of the Cash Processing tab in Receivables System Options are completed for the applicable business unit. This is a required step for the bank account onboarding process to create the related lockbox setups.\nReview and test the predefined setups generated during the onboarding process. You can also create new ones according to your business requirements.\nAutoMatch Rule Set â ORA_Automatch 90% (AutoMatch above 90% threshold)\nTask - Manage AutoMatch Rule Sets\n\nAutoCash Rule Set â ORA_Invoice Match (Directly match receipt to invoice)\nTask - Manage AutoCash Rule Sets\n\nTransmission Format â ORA_BAI2-EXTENDED_GENERIC\nNOTE:  This setup is for informational purposes only and should not be changed.\nTask - Manage Transmission Format for Lockbox\n\nBank Statement Processing\nFor foreign currency transactions, create tolerance rules and attach to the matching rule set for processing the automatic reconciliation of foreign transactions.\nAttach the cash and cash clearing accounts on the bank accounts to create accounting for the cleared events of payments and receipts.\nAttach the charge and cash account code combinations on the bank statement transaction creation rules to create the accounting for the external transactions generated for the bank charges or fees.\nUpdate Void Rejected Payments option at the bank account level to automatically void the original payments that are unreconciled after reconciling the reversal bank statement lines,\nEnable the reversal processing method for the receipt action after reconciling the direct debit return bank statement lines.\n\n\n### Key Resources\n\nRefer to the resources toUse Promotion Codes\n\n\n### Access Requirements\n\nYou must have the Financial Application Administrator job role to establish connectivity with BofA and to review all related predefined and automatically configured Functional Setup Manager tasks.\n\n\n| Payment File Status | Payment Status(IBY_PAYMENTS_ALL) | Payment Status(AP_CHECKS_ALL) |\n| File Level â File accepted | Acknowledged | Acknowledged | Negotiable |\n| File Level â Rejected | Rejected | Rejected / Voided | Negotiable/Voided |\n| Transaction Level â All payments accepted | Acknowledged | Acknowledged | Negotiable |\n| Transaction Level â Some payments rejected | Acknowledged | Respective payments are changed to rejected / voided status | Negotiable/Voided |",
